# Android Studio Mobile Application

A user interface in form of a mobile application that communicates with a\
web application via a [web server](https://github.com/mugabwa/Dwear).

This interface gives the user visual feedback of the data being collected\
from the [telemetry devices](https://github.com/mugabwa/Dwear-Arduino).

# Mobile Application Use Case

The mobile application is meant to be an end user application that enables\
a user to login, book a ride from one point to another. The navigation system\
is powered by Google Maps to enable a user to choose two or more points on the\
map. A suitable route is the selected using Google's navigation algorithms and a\
the distance information provided.

At the end of the trip, the telemetry data is used to estimate the cost of the\
dagame caused on the vehicle due to poor road surfaces.
